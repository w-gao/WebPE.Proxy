# WebPE.Proxy

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition WebSocket Proxy for the WebPE project

## What?

This is a proxy between a _WebSocket client_ and a _Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server_. This proxy allows a bi-directional communication between a browser (using the WebSocket protocol) and a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server (UDP protocol).

## Why?

WebPE is a project where it aims to let browsers connect to Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers through a proxy. The Minecraft protocol implementation is located in the [WebPE.js](https://github.com/w-gao/WebPE.Js) repository. This repo is simply the gateway between WebSocket and Raknet.
